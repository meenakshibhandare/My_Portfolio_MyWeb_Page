         <p>Video games are one of the most graphically and technically challenging computing problem. </p>
         <p> That is why most of the times they are developed using platform native technologies. 
         Modern Web has been slowly improving to start becoming a viable platform for video game
          developments and allowing developers to deploy games for all type of platforms
         The biggest driver for this is massive improvements in Javascript performance 
         ( thanks to JIT compiler technology)  and modern WebAPI’s. 
         There are several game engines like canvas which help develop all sort of games
         ranging from small games to huge RPG’s..</p>
